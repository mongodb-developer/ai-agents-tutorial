This repository contains everything needed to run a self-contained AI agents tutorial built using MongoDB, Gemini and LangGraph.

**NOTE:** In this lab, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive Python environment. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use [this](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/docs/dev-env/jupyter-notebooks) guide to familiarize yourself with the environment.

# Running the tutorial

You will be working in a Jupyter Notebook in a GitHub Codespace throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this tutorial.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/ai-agents-tutorial?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the container, and run the installation scripts. Once the environment is built, you should see a list of files appear under the Explorer. 

In the left navigation bar of the IDE, click on the file named `tutorial.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for this tutorial.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the interpreter that is marked as **Recommended** or **Global Env**.
